# Fencing Remote - Comprehensive Testing Guide

## Overview
This document provides systematic testing procedures for all fencing remote features.

---

## Test 1: Priority Round (Tie-Break) Functionality

### Setup
1. Start a match in period 3
2. Score to tie the match (e.g., 14-14)
3. Let timer reach 0:00

### Expected Behavior
- Timer expires with scores tied
- No automatic priority assignment
- User must manually click "Priority" button
- User chooses which fencer gets priority (left or right)
- Priority light appears on chosen side
- Next touch ends the match

### Test Steps
```
Step 1: Create a tie scenario
  1. Start timer
  2. Score to 14-14
  3. Let timer count down to 0:00
  4. Verify: Timer expires, scores remain tied

Step 2: Assign priority
  1. Click "Priority" button
  2. Choose priority position (left or right)
  3. Verify: Priority light appears on chosen side
  4. Verify: isPriorityRound = true

Step 3: Score on priority
  1. Score with fencer who has priority
  2. Verify: Alert shows "Priority Touch Scored!"
  3. Verify: User can confirm if they won on priority
  4. Verify: Match completes if yes

Step 4: Score without priority
  1. Score with fencer who doesn't have priority
  2. Verify: Match continues
  3. Verify: Next touch by priority fencer can still win
```

### Potential Issues to Check
- ‚ùå Priority round automatically triggering (should be manual)
- ‚ùå Priority light not appearing
- ‚ùå Priority popup not showing on first score
- ‚ùå Match not completing when priority fencer wins

  3. Verify: Alert shows "Match tied!"
  4. Verify: User must manually assign priority
  5. Verify: Priority button is enabled

Step 4: Period 3 Completion (Winner Scenario)
  1. Score to a winner (e.g., 15-12)
  2. Let timer reach 0:00 OR complete match
  3. Verify: Match can be completed
  4. Verify: Final score saved
```

### Potential Issues to Check
