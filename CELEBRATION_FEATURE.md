## Overview
Implemented a celebration feature that displays confetti and a congratulatory modal when users complete their goals.

---

## ✨ Features Implemented

### 1. **Confetti Animation** 🎊
- Uses `react-native-confetti-cannon` library
- 200 confetti pieces fired from top center
- Multi-colored confetti matching app theme:
  - Purple (primary)
  - Pink
  - Yellow
  - Blue
  - Green
  - Red
- Automatically fades out after animation

### 2. **Celebration Modal** 🏆
- Animated modal with spring animation
- Trophy emoji (🏆) at top
- "Congratulations!" title in purple
- Goal details display:
  - Goal title (e.g., "Total Matches Played")
  - Goal description (if provided)
  - Progress stats (e.g., "10/10")
  - "Target Reached!" label
- Two action buttons:
  - "View Progress" (secondary)
  - "Awesome!" (primary)
- Semi-transparent dark overlay backdrop

### 3. **Smart Detection** 🎯
- Detects **first-time** goal completion only
- Won't show celebration if goal was already complete
- Returns goal data for display in modal
- Multiple goals: Shows celebration for first completed goal

---

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **Backend Changes**

#### `lib/database.ts` - `updateGoalProgress()`
```typescript
// Before: Returns boolean
async updateGoalProgress(goalId, currentValue): Promise<boolean>

// After: Returns completion details
async updateGoalProgress(goalId, currentValue): Promise<{
  success: boolean;
  justCompleted: boolean;
  goalData?: {
    title: string;
    description: string;
    targetValue: number;
    currentValue: number;
  }
}>
```

**Logic:**
1. Fetch current goal state (including `is_completed`)
2. Calculate if goal is now complete: `currentValue >= targetValue`
3. Detect first-time completion: `!wasCompleted && isCompletedNow`
4. Update database with new completion status
5. Return completion details including goal data

#### `lib/database.ts` - `updateGoalsAfterMatch()`
```typescript
// Before: Returns void
async updateGoalsAfterMatch(...): Promise<void>

// After: Returns completed goals
async updateGoalsAfterMatch(...): Promise<{
  completedGoals: any[]
}>
```

**Logic:**
1. Track all completed goals in an array
2. For each goal that updates, check if `justCompleted`
3. If yes, add goal data to `completedGoals` array
4. Return array of all newly completed goals

---

### **Frontend Changes**

#### New Component: `components/GoalCelebrationModal.tsx`

**Props:**
```typescript
interface GoalCelebrationModalProps {
  visible: boolean;
  goalData: {
    title: string;
    description?: string;
    targetValue: number;
    currentValue: number;
  } | null;
  onClose: () => void;
}
```

**Features:**
- Confetti cannon ref for manual trigger
- Spring scale animation (0 → 1)
- Fade-in opacity animation
- Responsive sizing using `useWindowDimensions()`
- Fires confetti on modal appearance
- Resets animations on close

**Styling:**
- Dark theme matching app design
- Purple accent colors
- Rounded corners and shadows
- Responsive text and spacing
- Semi-transparent backdrop

#### Updated: `app/match-summary.tsx`

**New State:**
```typescript
const [showCelebration, setShowCelebration] = useState(false);
const [completedGoal, setCompletedGoal] = useState<any>(null);
```

**Updated `handleDone()` function:**
```typescript
const handleDone = async () => {
  // ... existing code ...
  
  // Update goals
  const result = await goalService.updateGoalsAfterMatch(...);
  
  // Check for completed goals
  if (result.completedGoals && result.completedGoals.length > 0) {
    setCompletedGoal(result.completedGoals[0]);
    setShowCelebration(true);
    return; // Don't navigate yet
  }
  
  // Navigate normally if no goals completed
  router.push('/(tabs)');
};
```

**New Handler:**
```typescript
const handleCelebrationClose = () => {
  setShowCelebration(false);
  setCompletedGoal(null);
  router.push('/(tabs)'); // Navigate after celebration
};
```

**JSX:**
```tsx
<GoalCelebrationModal
  visible={showCelebration}
  goalData={completedGoal}
  onClose={handleCelebrationClose}
/>
```

## 🎯 When Celebration Triggers

### **Triggers:**
- ✅ First time reaching target value
- ✅ After completing a match (via remote or manual)
- ✅ Only shows for goals that just completed this match

### **Does NOT Trigger:**
- ❌ If goal was already completed
- ❌ If goal progress increases but doesn't reach target
- ❌ If goal goes from 10/10 to 11/10 (already complete)
- ❌ When viewing old matches
- ❌ When setting a new goal

### **Example Scenarios:**

#### Scenario 1: First-Time Completion ✅
```
Before match: 9/10 matches (90%)
After match: 10/10 matches (100%)
Result: 🎉 CELEBRATION SHOWS!
```

#### Scenario 2: Already Complete ❌
```
Before match: 10/10 matches (100%)
After match: 11/10 matches (110%)
Result: No celebration (was already complete)
```

#### Scenario 3: Progress But Not Complete ❌
```
Before match: 7/10 matches (70%)
After match: 8/10 matches (80%)
Result: No celebration (not yet complete)
```

#### Scenario 4: Multiple Goals ✅
```
Match completes:
- Goal 1: 9/10 → 10/10 ✅ Completed!
- Goal 2: 8/15 → 9/15 ❌ Not complete
- Goal 3: 4/5 → 5/5 ✅ Completed!

Result: Shows celebration for Goal 1
(Could enhance to show both or cycle through)
```
