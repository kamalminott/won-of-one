## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **1. Removed Home Screen Confetti**

**File: `app/(tabs)/index.tsx`**

**Removed:**
- ❌ `import ConfettiCannon`
- ❌ `import useLocalSearchParams`
- ❌ `import useRef`
- ❌ `const params = useLocalSearchParams()`
- ❌ `const confettiRef = useRef<any>(null)`
- ❌ `useEffect` for triggering confetti
- ❌ `<ConfettiCannon>` component from JSX

**Result:** Cleaner home screen code, no confetti on navigation

---

### **2. Created SetNewGoalPrompt Component**

**File: `components/SetNewGoalPrompt.tsx`**

**Features:**
- 🎯 Slide-up animation from bottom
- 🎨 Dark theme matching app design
- 📱 Responsive sizing
- ⚡ Smooth transitions
- 🎭 Fade-in overlay

**Props:**
```typescript
interface SetNewGoalPromptProps {
  visible: boolean;
  completedGoal: {
    title: string;
    description?: string;
    targetValue: number;
  } | null;
  onSetGoal: () => void;
  onLater: () => void;
}
```

**Animations:**
- **Slide Up**: Spring animation (tension: 50, friction: 8)
- **Fade In**: Timing animation (300ms)
- **Entrance**: Slides from `height` to `0`
- **Exit**: Resets to `height` position

**Styling:**
- Bottom sheet modal style
- Rounded top corners (8% of width)
- Purple accent color
- Target emoji: 🎯
- Two-button layout: Secondary + Primary

---

### **3. Added Goal Deactivation**

**File: `lib/database.ts`**

**New Function:**
```typescript
async deactivateGoal(goalId: string): Promise<boolean> {
  console.log('🔒 Deactivating completed goal:', goalId);
  
  const { error } = await supabase
    .from('goal')
    .update({ 
      is_active: false,
      updated_at: new Date().toISOString()
    })
    .eq('goal_id', goalId);

  if (error) {
    console.error('Error deactivating goal:', error);
    return false;
  }

  console.log('✅ Goal deactivated successfully');
  return true;
}
```

**What it does:**
- Sets `is_active` to `false`
- Updates `updated_at` timestamp
- Removes goal from active goals list
- Preserves goal in database for history

**When called:**
- When user clicks "Maybe Later" on prompt
- After goal completion celebration

---

### **4. Integrated Prompt into Match Summary**

**File: `app/match-summary.tsx`**

**New State:**
```typescript
const [showNewGoalPrompt, setShowNewGoalPrompt] = useState(false);
const [completedGoalId, setCompletedGoalId] = useState<string | null>(null);
```

**Modified handleDone:**
```typescript
// Store goal ID when goal completes
const activeGoals = await goalService.getActiveGoals(user.id);
const matchingGoal = activeGoals.find(g => g.title === goalData.title);
if (matchingGoal) {
  setCompletedGoalId(matchingGoal.id);
}
```

**New Handler: handleCelebrationClose**
```typescript
const handleCelebrationClose = () => {
  setShowCelebration(false);
  // Show new goal prompt instead of navigating
  setShowNewGoalPrompt(true);
};
```

**New Handler: handleSetNewGoal**
```typescript
const handleSetNewGoal = () => {
  setShowNewGoalPrompt(false);
  setCompletedGoal(null);
  setCompletedGoalId(null);
  // Navigate to goal creation screen
  router.push('/set-goal');
};
```

**New Handler: handleLater**
```typescript
const handleLater = async () => {
  setShowNewGoalPrompt(false);
  
  // Deactivate the completed goal
  if (completedGoalId) {
    console.log('🔒 Deactivating goal:', completedGoalId);
    await goalService.deactivateGoal(completedGoalId);
  }
  
  setCompletedGoal(null);
  setCompletedGoalId(null);
  
  // Navigate to home
  router.push('/(tabs)');
};
```

**JSX Addition:**
```tsx
<SetNewGoalPrompt
  visible={showNewGoalPrompt}
  completedGoal={completedGoal}
  onSetGoal={handleSetNewGoal}
  onLater={handleLater}
/>
```

## 📊 Data Flow

```
Match Completes
    ↓
updateGoalsAfterMatch() returns { completedGoals: [...] }
    ↓
Store: completedGoal = goalData
Store: completedGoalId = matchingGoal.id
    ↓
Show: <GoalCelebrationModal visible={true} />
    ↓
User: Clicks "Awesome!"
    ↓
handleCelebrationClose()
    ↓
Hide: GoalCelebrationModal
Show: SetNewGoalPrompt
    ↓
User Chooses:
    ├─→ "Set New Goal"
    │       ↓
    │   handleSetNewGoal()
    │       ↓
    │   Clear state
    │       ↓
    │   router.push('/set-goal')
    │
    └─→ "Maybe Later"
            ↓
        handleLater()
            ↓
        deactivateGoal(goalId)
            ↓
        Clear state
            ↓
        router.push('/(tabs)')
```

## ✅ Benefits of New Flow

### **1. Less Overwhelming**

Before: 2 confetti + 2 modals = 4 UI elements
After:  1 confetti + 2 modals = 3 UI elements
Result: 25% less visual noise
```

### **2. Faster Call-to-Action**
```
Before: Celebrate → Navigate → Wait → Think "Now what?"
After:  Celebrate → "Set New Goal?" → Immediate decision
Result: User takes action while motivated
```

### **3. Higher Conversion**
```
Before: User might forget to set new goal
After:  Clear prompt to continue momentum
Result: More users set new goals
```

### **4. Cleaner Code**
```
Before: Confetti logic in 2 files + navigation params
After:  All celebration logic in match-summary.tsx
Result: Easier to maintain
```

### **5. Better UX**
```
Before: Two separate moments with unclear connection
After:  One celebration → One decision → Clear action
Result: More intuitive flow
```
