# Weekly Targets Implementation Summary

## ✅ What We Built

A complete **weekly training targets system** that allows users to:
1. Set weekly session targets for different activities
2. Manually log sessions via the +1 button
3. Track progress toward weekly goals
4. View historical data and plan future weeks

---

## 🗄️ Backend (Supabase)

### **Tables Created:**

#### 1. `weekly_target`
- Stores weekly session targets
- One target per user/activity/week
- Columns: `target_id`, `user_id`, `activity_type`, `week_start_date`, `week_end_date`, `target_sessions`, `created_at`, `updated_at`

#### 2. `weekly_session_log`
- Logs individual training sessions
- Manual entry only (no auto-increment from matches)
- Columns: `session_id`, `user_id`, `activity_type`, `session_date`, `duration_minutes`, `notes`, `created_at`

### **Security:**
- Row Level Security (RLS) enabled
- Users can only view/edit their own data
- Full CRUD policies in place

---

## 💻 Frontend Implementation

### **Files Modified:**

#### 1. `lib/database.ts`
**Added Services:**
- `weeklyTargetService` - Create, read, delete targets
- `weeklySessionLogService` - Log, delete, query sessions
- `weeklyProgressService` - Calculate current week progress

**Functions:**
```typescript
// Set a weekly target
weeklyTargetService.setWeeklyTarget(userId, activityType, weekStart, weekEnd, targetSessions)

// Log a session
weeklySessionLogService.logSession(userId, activityType, sessionDate?, durationMinutes?, notes?)

// Get current week progress
weeklyProgressService.getCurrentWeekProgress(userId, activityType)
```

#### 2. `components/ProgressCard.tsx`
**What Changed:**
- Now fetches real data from Supabase
- +1 button logs sessions to database
- "Save Target" creates/updates weekly targets
- "Clear Target" removes targets
- Real-time progress updates

**How It Works:**
1. Loads current week progress on mount
2. User can tap card to open modal
3. Select activity type and week
4. Set target number of sessions
5. Save → creates target in database
6. Use +1 button on main card to log sessions
7. Progress updates automatically

#### 3. `app/(tabs)/index.tsx`
**Simplified Usage:**
```typescript
<ProgressCard activityType="Conditioning" />
```

#### 4. `types/database.ts`
**Added Interfaces:**
- `WeeklyTarget`
- `WeeklySessionLog`

## 🎯 User Flow

### **Setting a Target:**
1. User taps "Sessions This Week" card
2. Modal opens with "Set Weekly Target"
3. Select activity (Conditioning, Footwork, etc.)
4. Select week (current or future)
5. Set target number (1-20 sessions)
6. Tap "Save Target"
7. Progress card updates with target

### **Logging Sessions:**
1. User completes a training session
2. Taps +1 button on progress card
3. Session logs to database
4. Progress updates (e.g., 3/5 → 4/5)
5. Days remaining countdown continues

### **Viewing Progress:**
- Main card shows: "3/5" (current/target)
- Visual progress bar
- "5 Days Left" pill
- Activity type subtitle ("Conditioning")

---

## 🔧 Activity Types Supported

- **Conditioning** (default)
- **Footwork**
- **1-2-1 Lessons**
- **Recovery**
- **Video Review**

Each can have separate weekly targets.

## 📊 Data Tracking

### **What's Tracked:**
- ✅ Weekly targets per activity type
- ✅ Session count per week
- ✅ Days remaining in week
- ✅ Completion rate (%)
- ✅ Historical sessions (by date)

### **What's NOT Tracked (Yet):**
- ❌ Auto-increment from matches
- ❌ Session duration/quality
- ❌ Streaks
- ❌ Multi-week trends

---

## 🚀 Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

### **Phase 2 Features:**
1. **Analytics Dashboard**
   - Week-over-week trends
   - Completion rate history
   - Best performing weeks
   
2. **Notifications**
   - Reminder if falling behind
   - Celebration on hitting target
   
3. **Multiple Activities**
   - Set targets for all activities at once
   - Combined progress view
   
4. **Smart Suggestions**
   - Auto-suggest targets based on history
   - "Copy from last week" button

5. **Session Details**
   - Add notes to each session
   - Track duration
   - Rate session quality
